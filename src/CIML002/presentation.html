      </p>
      <p>
	Teams is highly integrated with other products in the Microsoft suite, including Word, 
	PowerPoint and Excel, making it a true collaboration platform. Created to compete with Slack,

    <h2>Slide 14: Recommendation of OS</h2>
      <p>
	The recommended OS will be Windows and below are the explanation of 
	our choice. 
      </p>
      <p>
	When deciding which OS is the best depends on the user's individual needs. FOr those looking for an intuitive and reliable platfrom with a wide 
 	variety of features, Mac OS is likely their best bet. However, for users looking for more powerful performance in which they have more control,
 	Windows is their best option.
      </p>
      <p>
	Windows is known for its performance, with the latest version of the OS being able to handle multiple tasks at once. Additoonally Windows 11 
 	computers are incredibly versatile, can run powerful applicaiton on low-end hardware. Windows offers a great user experience but it is not
 	quite as intuitive as Mac OS. Getting used to Microsoft idiosyncrasies can take some time. However, once users become familiar with the
 	Windows interface, they will be able to work more quickly than Mac users.
      </p>
      <p>
	Windows is the best choice for business use because Windows OS is the most widely used OS in the world. More people are using Windows because
 	most of the software you need for school or work purpose are supported by Windows.
      </p>

    <h2>Slide 15: Recommendation of video collaboration tools</h2>
      <p>
        The recommended video colloboration tool will be teams and below are the explanation for our choice.
      </p>
      <p>
	Microsoft teams is incredibly straght foreward and user-friendly. There is little to no setup required. Still some thinking must be done into
 	how a business wants to use the teams platform before rollng it out across the company.
      </p>
      <p>
	Actually we can also choose to do something involving both or something in between. What is right for a particular business depends on its 
 	culture and use cases. Teams can be controlled and configured directly from the Teams admin centre.
      </p>

    <h2>Slide 24: DHCP</h2>
      <p>
	DHCP or dynamic host configuration protocol is a client / server protocol, rely on both 
	server and client to fulfill certain properties. Between server and client roles, the 
	DHCP server is more important because it is the server that most of the functionality 
	of the DHCP is actually implemented. The server maintains the configuration database,
	keeps track of the address ranges and manages leases. For this reason, DHCP servers 
	are typically more complex than DHCP clients.
      </p>
      <p>
	In essence, without a DHCP server, there really is no DHCP. Thus deciding how to 
	implement DHCP servers is a large part of implementing the protocol. It is useful to
	look at how DHCP servers are set up and used, to help put into perspective how
	the protocol works.
      </p>

    <h2>Slide 25: Picture of DHCP screenshot</h2>
      <p>
	This slide shows a DHCP console.
      </p>
      <p>
	To add DHCP role using Server Manager, select Add Roles and Features, and then select DHCP 
	in the Roles list.
      </p>
      <p>
	To access this DHCP console click start -> Windows Administrative Tool -> DHCP
