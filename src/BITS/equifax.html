    <h1>Equifax breach</h1>
    <p><b>Part (c) Spending money on security controls</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you had $1 million to spend on security controls, would
        you spend most on preventive controls, defective controls or
        corrective controls?</li>
      <li>What kind of controls would you spend least on?</li>
      <li>Why?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Some suggestions / clarifications on this part of the task:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There is no right or wrong answer. No hard and fast rule on this matter.</li>
      <li>there are always arguments for and against for a certain position.</li>
      <li>You might want to lay out some assumptions if there are any</li>
      <li>You can research and see what others say. If you use their arguments, 
        please make reference to them 
      </li>
      <li>You can use scenarios to illustrate your point</li>
      <li>You should develop your own postiion and argue for your answer</li>
      <li>Your argument should not be significiantly more than 2-3 pages long 
        (if you use single line spacing)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preventive Controls</h2>
    <p>Avoid an incident from happening</p>
    <h3>Administrative</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Data classification and labelling</li>
      <p>Protect private information like Equifax systems using a 
      susceptible version of Apache Struts web framework from being indexed 
      by search engines. Put the information on private access website</p>
      
      <li>Data retention policy</li>
      <p>
        Avoid storing sensitive information beyong the time necessary 
        to provide the service.
        Unnecessary retaining of customer's information that was no 
        longer needed lead to broader exposure of customer's information 
        during an attack. 
      </p>
      
      <li>Update communication policy</li>
      <p>
        Equifax's IS team received alerts from US Computer Emergency 
        Readiness Team (US-CERT) about Apache Struts framework 
        vulnerability on Mar 8 2017, before the time of compromise 
        on May 13 2017.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The person operating the Automated Consumer Interview System 
        (ACIS) did not receive the alert as he/she was not part of the
        email recipient list. Thus, the patching process was not
        proactive. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Recommendation: there should be effective communication policy 
        between the IS and IT teams.
      </p>
      
      <li>Executive priorities</li>
      <p>
        Executive compensation rules were focused on profit, motivating 
        them to prioritize revenue above all other considerations, 
        including information security. Thus information security was not
        given much priority which lead to security breaches.
      </p>
      <p>
        The recommendation is that IS and IT teams should report directly 
        to either Chief Risk Officer, Chief Executive Officer or Chief 
        Information Officer. This ensures security is represented at 
        the executive level.
      </p>
      
      <li>Security Awareness framework</li>
      <p>
        Request management to have company wide cyber security 
        management framework and ensure its adequate staffing and 
        budget.

    <h3>Physical</h3>
    
    <h3>Technical</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Implement WAF and DLP system</li>
      <p>Equifax's Automated Consumer Interview System (ACIS) system 
      comprises 2 web servers, 2 application servers 
      and a network-level firewall. This system was open to accepting 
      malicious requests as it was not protected by a WAF.</p>
      <p>A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a layer of protection in 
      addition to network-level firewall. It protects web applicaiton 
      from SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS) and distributed 
      Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. WAF could have prevented the
      exploitation of Apache Struts vulnerability.</p>
      <p>A Data Loss Prevention (DLS) system which identify, monitor and  
      potentially avert unauthorized moves of sensitive data in and 
      out of the network. DLS could have prevented the 
      massive exfiltration 14-16 Gb of data during 76 days undetected.</p>
      
      <li>Isolation or compartmentalization</li>
      <p>
        Computer sub-systems should be compartmentalized using physical 
        devices or security controls. Equifax's Automated Consumer 
        Interview System (ACIS) application was not 
        segmented from other unrelated databases. The Sun systems, which 
        hosted ACIS, had shared file systems, notes or configuration 
        files from one system and can be accessed from other systems. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Un-encrypted credentials to other sensitive databases were 
        stored. Excessive amount of confidential information and 
        Personal Identifiable Information (PII) was also stored.
      </p>
      
      <li>Encryption for Personal Indentifiable Information (PII)</li>
      <p>
        None of the PII from the stolen data was encrypted, therefore 
        compormising the confidentialty of the stolen PII. Encryption, 
        truncation, masking or hashing of the critical PII is needed. 
        Proper management of encryption keys can protect encrypted data. 
        Even if encrypted data was stolen but encryption keys are not 
        comporomised, event is not considered a data breach.
      </p>
      
      <li>Strong password</li>
      <p>
        Some Equifax's IT system privileged accounts have weak passwords. 
        E.g. one database has a four lowercase-letter password which 
        matched the name of the database. A portal used for credit 
        dispute had username "admin" and password "admin" for an
        administrative account.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Suggested strong password should be at least 12 characters long, 
        a combination of uppercase, lowercase letters, numbers and 
        symbols. Not a word that can be found in the dictionary, or 
        name of a person, character, product or organization.
      </p>
      <li>Least privilege access</li>
      <p>
        The principle of least privilege - every user in a system 
        should be granted only a minimum set of permissions to perform 
        the desginated task.    
      </p>
      <p>
        Equifax's Automated Consumer Interview System (ACIS) has 
        excessive access to other systems not required 
        for its operations. ACIS only needed access to 3 databases to 
        function, but it was unnecessarily connected to many more.
      </p>
      <li>Knowledge in use of vulnerability scanners</li>
      <p>
        The Equifax IS team scan the system exposed to the internet 
        using McAfee Vulnerability Manager tool. However, the scan was 
        on the root directory, not the subdirectory where Apache Struts
        framework was listed. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It was known that the detection rate of vulnerabilty scanners 
        did not exceed 80% for most scans. Also, Apache Struts was not 
        managed via a package manager but was distributed as a standalone
        JAR file.
      </p>
      <p>
        The identification of Apache Struts framework vulnerability also 
        require knowledge of the application URL path. When not provided, 
        the scanner did not pick up the vulnerability. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The IS team accepted the false-negative result as confirmation 
        that Equifax's system did not have a problem.
      </p>
      
      <li>Adopt Zero-trust security model</li>
      <p>
        The components of a system must mistrust all requests from 
        other parts of the system until they are authenticated and 
        authorized.
      </p>
      
    </ol>

    <h3>Technical</h3>
    
    <ol>
      <li>logs</li>
      <p>Consult Mandiant (now part of Google cloud) security team. 
        Both Equifax and Mandiant
        security teams analyzed digital forensic data using tools  
        including Arkime (formerly known as Moloch) - by keeping a 
        record of network's internal communication and data traffic. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Using Arkime, investigators reconstructed every step: once the 
        attackers found the vulnerability, they installed a backdoor 
        known as a web shell. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually the intruders installed more than 30 web shells, each 
        on a different web address. Groups known to exploit with web 
        shells most effectively include teams with links to Chinese
        Intelligence. In total, the attackers ran approximately 9,000 queries
        on Equifax’s system, obtaining names, birth dates and social security 
        numbers for nearly 145 million Americans. Wu Zhiyong, Wang Qian, 
        Xu Ke and Liu Lei, members of the PLA’s 54th Research Institute, 
        a component of the Chinese military were charged. 
      </p>
      <li>Intruder Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS)</li>
      <p>
        Automated SSL certification management tool was implemented but 
        did not complete before the hacking incident. Avoid manual 
        process of tracking and updating several hundred SSL certificates.
        This process was error prone and depended on individual responsible 
        for IT systems. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Equifax's IDS/IPS was not able to detect malicious traffic leaving 
        the system due to an expired SSL certificate in Nov 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lack of alerts to the IS team that the IDS/IPS was not operational 
        for 9 months (until July 2017). Lack of warning possible as system 
        settings allow traffic to bypass IDS/IPS in case it was unable to 
        function.
