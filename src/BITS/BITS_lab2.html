      <li>Is it a good idea to reuse password? Why?</li>
      <p>
        The more a password is reused, the more opportunities there are for that password to be compromised or stolen.
      </p>
      <li>Why should all passwords expire?</li>
      <p>
        Yes, the shorter the password expiration policy, the shorter their window to compromise systems and exfiltrate data.
      </p>
      <li>Why should we have minimum length for password?</li>
      <p>
        Short passwords can be easily broken with tools that do dictionary or brute force attacks against the passwords.
      </p>
      <li>Why should the lockout an account after a certain number of failed attempts.</li>
      <p>
        Brute force password attacks can be automated to try thousands or even millions of password combinations for any or all user accounts. Limiting the number of failed sign-ins that can be performed nearly eliminates the effectiveness of such attacks.
      </p>
      <li>Why should there be a 30 min waiting period before we are allowed to unlock the account?</li>
      <p>
        A denial-of-service (DoS) condition can be created if an attacker abuses the Account lockout threshold policy setting and repeatedly attempts to sign in with a specific account.
