	<h3>Preventive Control</h3>
	<ol>
	  <li>Private Web access</li>
	  <p>
		Put private information regarding Equifax's susceptible 
		version of web framework on private access website
		not indexed by search engine.
	  </p>
	  <li>Data Retention Policy</li>
	  <p>
		Avoid storing customer's sensitive information beyond the time 
		necessary to provide the service.
	  </p>
	  <li>Update communication policy</li>
	  <p>
		The person in charge of patching the web portal
		did not receive the alert as he/she was not part of the email recipient 
		list. Thus, the patching process was not proactive. 
	  </p>
	  <li>Security Awareness Framework</li>
	  <p>
		Request management to have company-wide cyber security management
		framework and ensure its adequate staffing and budget. Equifax can also
		share its latest security framework with other companies.
	  </p>
	  <li>Web Application Firewall (WAF)</li>
	  <p>
		 It protects web applications from SQL injections and other attacks. 
		 WAF could have prevented the exploitation of Equifax's vulnerability.
	  </p>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>Preventive Control</h3>
	<ol>
	  <li>Data Loss Prevention (DLS) system</li>
	  <p>
		 It identifies, monitors and potentially averts unauthorized moves 
		 of sensitive data in and out of the network. DLS could have prevented 
		 the massive out flow of 14-16 Gb of data for 76 days undetected.
	  </p>
	  <li>Segmentation of systems</li>
	  <p>
		Equifax had shared file systems, notes or configuration 
		files from one system and can be accessed from other systems
	  </p>
	  <li>Encryption for Personal Identifiable Information (PII)</li>
	  <p>
		None of the PII from the stolen data was encrypted, therefore
		compromising the confidentiality of the stolen PII. Encryption, truncation,
		masking or hashing of the critical PII is needed.
	  </p>
	  <li>Strong password</li>
	  <p>
		one database has a password which matched
		the name of the database. An online portal had default username
		"admin" and password "admin" for an administrative account.
	  </p>
	  <li>Knowledge in use of vulnerability scanners</li>
	  <p>
		Equifax IS team scanned the system exposed to the internet at root
		directory, not the subdirectory where vulnerabil;ity was listed. 
		Better training is needed.
	  </p>
	</ol>
	<h3>Defective Control</h3>
	<ol>
	  <li>Intruder Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS)</li>
	  <p>
		Equifax's IDS/IPS was not able to detect malicious traffic leaving the
		system due to an expired SSL certificate from Nov 2016 to July 2017. 
		A working Automated SSL certificate management tool is needed.
	  </p>
	  <li>Network logs forensics</li>
	  <p>
		Consult Mandiant (now part of Google cloud) security team. Both Equifax
		and Mandiant security teams analyzed digital forensic data, they found
		attackers installed a backdoor in Equifax's servers.
	  </p> 
	</ol>
	<h3>Corrective Control</h3>
	<ol>
	  <li>Server Images</li>
	  <p>
		One way to correct online servers infected by malware is 
		restoring from offline server images, which remain 
		untouched by the threat actors. 
 	  </p>
	</ol>
