	<h3>Justification for controls</h3>

	<p>
		We recommend using more money and human resources in implementing 
		<b>preventive</b> controls to improve the security of the company. This 
		strategy will deter most of the data breaches from happening at the 
		first place.   
	</p>

	<p>
		On the event that a data breach can overcome the preventive strategy, 
		there is still defective and corrective controls in place. However, our 
		emphasis is still on prevention measures rather than damage control. 
	</p>

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>
		The loss or unauthorized disclosure of information in a data breach can
		lead to serious consequences and can result in substantial harm to
		individuals and reputation lost to the organization. 
	</p>

	<p>
		As prevention is better than cure, businesses and organiations should 
		not neglect the cyber security aspect. Previous security breaches provide
		good learning opportunities to adopt the best security strategies, 
		preventing future similar breaches and making it safer to navigate the 
		online world.
