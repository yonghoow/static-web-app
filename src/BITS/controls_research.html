    <h3>18.1.2.1 Ensure 'Allow Input Personalization' is set to 'Disabled'</h3>
    <h4>Problem:</h4>
    <p>
      Automatic learning enables the collection of speech and handwriting patterns, typing history, contacts, 
      and recent calendar information.
      If this setting is Enabled sensitive information could be stored in the cloud or sent to Microsoft.
    </p>
    <h4>Improvement:</h4>
    <p>
      Disabling this prevents sensitive information to be stored in the cloud.
    </p>
    
    <h3>18.4.8.1 Ensure 'Enable insecure guest logons' is set to 'Disabled'</h3>
    <h4>Problem:</h4>
    <p>
      Clients that allow insecure guest logons are vulnerable to a variety of man-in-the-middle 
      attacks that can result in data loss, data corruption, and exposure to malware. 
      Additionally, any data written to a file server using an insecure guest logon is 
      potentially accessible to anyone on the network
    </p>
    <h4>Improvement:</h4>
    <p>
      prevent man-in-the-middle-attack
    </p>
    
    <h3>18.4.11.2 Ensure 'Prohibit installation and configuration of Network Bridge on your 
        DNS domain network' is set to 'Enabled'</h3>
    <h4>Problem:</h4>
    <p>
      A Network Bridge thus allows a computer that has connections to two different networks 
      to share data between those networks. Allowing users to create a Network Bridge increases 
      the risk and attack surface from the bridged network.
    </p>
    <h4>Improvement:</h4>
    <p>
      Users cannot create or configure a Network Bridge, reduce risk of attack to share data 
      between different networks.
    </p>
    
    <h3>18.4.11.3 Ensure 'Prohibit use of Internet Connection Sharing on your DNS domain network' 
        is set to 'Enabled'</h3>
    <h4>Problem:</h4>
    <p>
      Non-administrators should not be able to turn on the Mobile Hotspot feature and open 
      their Internet connectivity up to nearby mobile devices.
    </p>
    <h4>Improvement:</h4>
    <p>
      Mobile Hotspot cannot be enabled or configured by Administrators and 
      non-Administrators alike
    </p>
    
    <h3>18.4.11.4 Ensure 'Require domain users to elevate when setting a network's location' 
        is set to 'Enabled'</h3>
    <h4>Problem:</h4>
    <p>
      Allowing regular users to set a network location increases the risk and attack surface
    </p>
    <h4>Improvement:</h4>
    <p>
      Domain users must elevate when setting a network's location. It reduces the risk and
      attack surface.
    </p>
    
    <h3>18.4.21.1 Ensure 'Minimize the number of simultaneous connections to the Internet or 
        a Windows Domain' is set to 'Enabled'</h3>
    <h4>Problem:</h4>
    <p>
      Preventing bridged network connections can help prevent a user unknowingly allowing 
      traffic to route between internal and external networks, which risks exposure to 
      sensitive internal data
    </p>
    <h4>Improvement:</h4>
    <p>
      While connected to an Ethernet connection, Windows won't allow use of a WLAN 
      (automatically or manually) until Ethernet is disconnected. It prevents exposure 
      of internal data to external networks.
    </p>
    
    <h3>18.4.21.2 Ensure 'Prohibit connection to non-domain networks when connected to domain authenticated network' is set to 'Enabled'</h3>
    <h4>Problem:</h4>
    <p>
      The potential concern is that a user would unknowingly allow network traffic to flow between the insecure public network 
      and the enterprise managed network.
    </p>
    <h4>Improvement:</h4>
    <p>
      When the computer is already connected to either a non-domain based network or a domain 
      based network over Ethernet, and a user attempts to create a manual connection to an 
      additional network in violation of this policy setting, the existing Ethernet 
      connection is maintained and the manual connection attempt is blocked.
    </p>
    
    <h3>18.4.23.2.1 Ensure 'Allow Windows to automatically connect to suggested open hotspots, 
        to networks shared by contacts, and to hotspots offering paid services' is set 
        to 'Disabled'</h3>
    <h4>Problem:</h4>
    <p>
      Automatically connecting to an open hotspot or network can introduce the system to a rogue network 
      with malicious intent.
    </p>
    <h4>Improvement:</h4>
    <p>
      Connect to suggested open hotspots, Connect to networks shared by my contacts, and 
      Enable paid services will each be turned off and users on the device will be 
      prevented from enabling them.
    </p>
    
    <h3>18.8.3.1 Ensure 'Include command line in process creation events' is set to 'Disabled'</h3>
    <h4>Problem:</h4>
    <p>
      Automatically connecting to an open hotspot or network can introduce the system 
      to a rogue network with malicious intent.
    </p>
    <h4>Improvement:</h4>
    <p>
      Connect to suggested open hotspots, Connect to networks shared by my contacts, and 
      Enable paid services will each be turned off and users on the device will be 
      prevented from enabling them.
    </p>
    
    <h3>18.8.12.1 Ensure 'Boot-Start Driver Initialization Policy' is set to 'Enabled: Good, 
        unknown and bad but critical'</h3>
    <h4>Problem:</h4>
    <p>
      If your malware detection application does not include an Early Launch Antimalware 
      boot-start driver or if your Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver has been 
      disabled, this setting has no effect
    </p>
    <h4>Improvement:</h4>
    <p>
      This policy setting helps reduce the impact of malware that has already 
      infected your system.
    </p>
    
    <h3>18.8.19.2 Ensure 'Configure registry policy processing: Do not apply 
        during periodic background processing' is set to 'Enabled: FALSE'</h3>
    <h4>Problem:</h4>
    <p>
      When background updates are disabled, policy changes will not take 
      effect until the next user logon or system restart.
    </p>
    <h4>Improvement:</h4>
    <p>
      Setting this option to false (unchecked) will ensure that domain policy 
      changes take effect more quickly, as compared to waiting until the next user logon 
      or system restart.
    </p>
    
    <h3>18.8.19.3 Ensure 'Configure registry policy processing: Process even if the Group   
        Policy objects have not changed' is set to 'Enabled: TRUE'</h3>
    <h4>Problem:</h4>
    <p>
      if disabled, group policies are not reapplied if they have not been changed. Unauthorized 
      local changes configured that do not match the domain-based Group policy settings goes 
      undetected.
    </p>
    <h4>Improvement:</h4>
    <p>
      Setting this option to true (checked) will ensure unauthorized changes that might 
      have been configured locally are forced to match the domain-based Group Policy settings 
      again.
    </p>
    
    <h3>18.8.19.4 Ensure 'Continue experiences on this device' is set to 'Disabled'</h3>
    <h4>Problem:</h4>
    <p>
      Windows device is allowed to participate in cross-device experiences. A cross-device 
      experience is when a system can access app and send messages to other devices
    </p>
    <h4>Improvement:</h4>
    <p>
      In an enterprise managed environment only trusted systems should be communicating within 
      the network. Access to any other system should be prohibited.
    </p>
    
    <h3>18.8.25.1 Ensure 'Block user from showing account details on sign-in' is set to 'Enabled'</h3>
    <h4>Problem:</h4>
    <p>
      An attacker with access to the console (for example, someone with physical access or 
      someone who is able to connect to the server through Remote Desktop Services) could 
      view the name of the last user who logged on to the server. The attacker could then try 
      to guess the password, use a dictionary, or use a brute-force attack to try and log on.
    </p>
    <h4>Improvement:</h4>
    <p>
      This policy prevents the user from showing account details (email address or user name) 
      on the sign-in screen.
    </p>
    
    <h3>18.8.25.2 Ensure 'Do not display network selection UI' is set to 'Enabled'</h3>
    <h4>Problem:</h4>
    <p>
      An unauthorized user could disconnect the PC from the network or can connect the PC 
      to other available networks without signing into Windows.
    </p>
    <h4>Improvement:</h4>
    <p>
      Not displaying network selection UI prevents anyone from interacting with available 
      networks UI on the logon screen.
    </p>
    
    <h3>18.8.25.3 'Do not enumerate connected users on domain-joined computers' is set to 
        'Enabled'</h3>
    <h4>Problem:</h4>
    <p>
      A malicious user could use this feature to gather account names of other users, that 
      information could then be used in conjunction with other types of attacks such as 
      guessing passwords or social engineering.
    </p>
    <h4>Improvement:</h4>
    <p>
      This policy setting prevents connected users from being enumerated on domain-joined 
      computers.
    </p>
    
    <h3>18.8.25.4 Ensure 'Enumerate local users on domain-joined computers' is set to 'Disabled'</h3>
    <h4>Problem:</h4>
    <p>
      A malicious user could use this feature to gather account names of other users, that 
      information could then be used in conjunction with other types of attacks such as 
      guessing passwords or social engineering. The value of this countermeasure is small 
      because a user with domain credentials could gather the same account information using 
      other methods.
    </p>
    <h4>Improvement:</h4>
    <p>
      This policy setting prevents local users from being enumerated on domain-joined computers.
    </p>
